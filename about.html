          In the late 2020, I started learning about web development, Where I
          found Django since i already knew python, which i learned in 2018 to
          help me in bug bounty & writing scripts and PoCs for security bugs.
          After Learning django from a book named Django3 by example by Antonio
          Mel√©. I did some freelance work together with my friend
          <a href="https://b3nsh4.com">ben</a> After that i got curious about
          frontend and some stumbled upon React Docs but it was too hard &
          confusing for me so grabbed another book named The road to react by
          Robin Wieruch which i completed it in 2021.

          methodologies for various vulnerabilities & started testing
          applications of many Big tech giants like Xiaomi.
