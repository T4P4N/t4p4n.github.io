                    Django3 by example by Antonio Mel√©. I started working on my own projects, where i found 
                    a need to learn more about interactive frontend using javascript, I  started learning about 
                    React but it was too hard for so grabbed another book named The road to react by Robin Wieruch
                    which i completed it in last year.
