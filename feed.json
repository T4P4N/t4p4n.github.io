Currently we are importing the file, parsing the entire file, then running a filter on it to query whatever the user searches.In the ticket it was mentioned that I need to create a table in the db, seed this data to the table &amp; add indexes if required, and make sure the endpoint returns performant results.Now the data was not normalized, it contained some repeated data like description was there in the parent object as well as inside the tax_slabs array.And there was a boolean (has_value_based_rates) on the parent object, which mentions if there are slabs. If it’s true then the tax_slabs will have more than one entry plus there will be min, max values and the GST rate.While prompting I referenced the relevant files, added one sample entry from the json file, and pasted the ticket contents.It wrote a script for seeding the db and a prisma schema. And asked to run prisma migrate, I did it without giving much attention, thinking let it cook for some time.Upon checking the schema, it was using CUID for Primary Key in the table, created columns for all fields, added an index on the hsnCode field, even though it was already marked as a unique field, and a unique constraint cannot work without being indexed.After seeing this, I still let it go, then I ran the migrate cmd, ran the seed script, inspected the table by checking all the columns, and doing some sorting stuff to figure out what can be removed and what can be improved.After I prompted again to first make the tax_slabs json column null, cause only 52 rows had data, it did that. However, it made it null as in putting “null” in the json column and not null as in Postgres NULL. This is pretty deceptive actually but it caught my eye somehow.After this I prompted again to change from CUID to integer based IDs which are more performant as well as good fit the use case here perfectly. Even though integer based IDs are guessable, but since this data is already public, nothing sensitive in there, so integer based IDs are naturally a perfect fit for this use case.And prompted again to remove the redundant description from the tax_slabs object, (i know its not that redudant actually, only 52 rows, but still i removed it though XD.).After this point the table started looking good to me. Then I prompted again to replace the json file import with a db call in endpoint for querying the hsn master table via prisma.Now it’s done and working just fine. I still think things can be improved here like putting tax slabs in another table and referencing that in the hsn master table. But I think that’s optimization for another day. Postgres is already good enough to handle this small amount of data. At this point I think the time &amp; effort to optimise further won’t give much of a meaningful performance improvement.",

            "content_text": "Starting with work, as usual, Mostly remained same, in-fact it became a bit easy thanks to claude, But but, You need to test things out manually which is a bit time consuming, also if the code written have like small very minor bugs (runtime bugs to be specific), which are very hard to spot &amp; catch, you have test the feature multiple times with different inputs to figure out the bugs.One annoying thing for me is reading the AI generated code, it’s good most of the times, but it makes mistakes that no human coder ever would. Like putting functions in the useState, using useCallback on every function inside the component, i won’t blame AI for this, it’s just react have this weird coding patterns. As backend code it writes a hell lot of utility functions, unnecessary abstractions, and sometimes even breaks the usual JS conventions.Daily routine remained same as last year, till the month of may,In may, i moved out a different place, previously i was staying in one 1RK apartment with one of my office colleague.But Now i’m staying in a 3BHK, since i moved here, i made new friends, not just new but also hindi speaking ones, we are 4 guys here who are here everyday n night, And one guy comes only once in a week.Also the rent is a bit lower than my previous stay.And i also started cooking lunch as well, previously i used to cook breakfast &amp; dinner only.As for financial stuff, i got an increment this year, in the month of may, i guess, financially speaking i’m good for now, Also i started investing in stocks,currently having with an unrealised loss :(, I brought the house stocks, aka BSE, NSDL &amp; CDSL etc. And the reason is that my entry was at the wrong time, all these stocks were at their all time high, when i brought these stocks. Anyhow hopefully it will get recovered in the upcoming years. Also In the last two months, I did some IPOs as well, there i made good profits. :)Some random stuff which i did this year:In jan, i went to Mamalakandam, with shaheem on the bike, it was a great experience, because there not many people were there, we explored the area, clicked few photos, and came back the same day. Relatively short trip, But i like short trips more than long trips which extends more than 2-3 days day. :)Booked tickets &amp; went to attend a standup comedy show of Abhishek Upmanyu Initially i was thinking that i won’t be able to laugh that much as an introvert, but as soon as show started, i couldn’t able to control my laughter, because the jokes &amp; punches were hilarious.In the mid of July, i went to kadambrayar bridge along with my flatmates in the morning, very short trip, we reached there, and had some tea, clicked photos &amp; had breakfast from outside, &amp; came back to our flat, Also this short trip was sponsored by Me :)In the end of July, i went to kadamakudy, it was office trip,did kayaking for an hour, and it started raining in between, and i got fully wet, luckily my phone survived, after that we headed to alappuzha, Onboarded on a house boat, had some drinks, had lunch, times flies, i really enjoyed the view from the house boat. After that we headed to marari beachWe sat on beach, stared at the incoming waves, enjoyed a lot!After that we headed back to kochi.In the mid of august, i went to vattavada village with flatmates and few other guys.It was two day trip, and we were 7 people, distance: 270KMs one way, the main goal for the trip is to see the mountains &amp; also to try out magic mushrooms, It was once in lifetime experience.So We left our flat at 3am on 15th august, reached that place at 9am,took 2 breaks in between, had some tea &amp; snacks, it was all rainy &amp; cold, with some patchy sunshine in between.Everything went great &amp; we stayed there for one day &amp; came back next day.On 28 September 2025, i went to subash bose park with benI brought some dryfruits for the home, talked a lot about various things in life.We sat down in the park, talked about tech, linux &amp; life so far, did some deep thinking, thought about my life so far, and clicked some photos, and came back to flat.After this day i had mental breakdown kinda, i can’t share it because of some personal reasons, but it was terrible, i felt like i was used emotionally, And being ignored afterwards, I felt like i lost myself, the things that were once fun for me. those things no longer gave me any kind of joy, i used to do so many things like playing games, cooking &amp; eating food of my choice, listening to music &amp; podcasts etc. But none of these things were giving me any kind joy or satisfaction, i was overthinking, exhausted, anxious and my sleep was messed up entirely. I was in a terrible state of mind, but luckily it only lasted 2 weeks or something. So moving forwardOn 11th Oct, took a flight to delhi, Spent some time with family, celebrated dewali &amp; visited my sisters. Met two of my close school friends, but enjoyed a lot.My inner peace returned, i started enjoying things slowly. And i cameback to kochi on 16th Nov. Things were normal from now on, I was back with a mature emotional mind. Until after sometime i started doing the same overthinking, but this time it was not that bad i would say. Anyhow, moving onOn 22 December, We went to kuzhupilly with our office team, i went to the beach, brought ticket for floating bridge, visited that, after that i sat down on the beach, There was a school kid, who was standing near me. I started talking to him, and we talked about cricket, studies, language etc.After that i left the beach &amp; walked back to my place, Clicked a few photos along the way. Attended the christmas party, had a few drinks for energy, danced for a few seconds (cause yk i’m an introvert), went to the pool, tried swimming but failed, had a lot of fun in the pool, after that i took a shower, had dinner, slept, woke up next day, packed my bags, &amp; came back to flat.And i think that’s was it, mostly, I’ve written about major events happened in my life this year. Whether good or bad, idk how things will be in the future.Looking forward to next year, Hopes are high! :)Thanks for reading till the end &amp;Wishing you a Happy new year!",

After that we headed to <a href=\"https://www.keralatourism.org/kerala-article/2022/marai-beach-alappuzha/1204\">marari beach</a></p><p>We sat on beach, stared at the incoming waves, enjoyed a lot!</p><p>After that we headed back to kochi.<img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/2a1ddaa1-7a1c-4d5d-aeac-5ec93214fa52?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Kadamakuddy\" /><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/5e1b5bab-e439-4d2e-9542-a3be32081863?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Kayaking\" /><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/bbe4f38d-187d-4dac-a0ca-c4538b15b09b?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Alapuzzha back waters\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/7ac98235-afa2-4a20-b23a-d5601bb2b157?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"marari beach\" /></p><hr /><p>In the mid of august, i went to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vattavada\">vattavada village</a> with flatmates and few other guys.</p><p>It was two day trip, and we were 7 people, distance: 270KMs one way, the main goal for the trip is to see the mountains &amp; also to try out magic mushrooms, It was once in lifetime experience.</p><p>So We left our flat at 3am on 15th august, reached that place at 9am,</p><p>took 2 breaks in between, had some tea &amp; snacks, it was all rainy &amp; cold, with some patchy sunshine in between.</p><p>Everything went great &amp; we stayed there for one day &amp; came back next day.<br /><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/b554528e-1b57-4670-a941-79b348753f30?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=\" alt=\"Munnar\" /><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/e5d75840-4149-40e5-91e7-9e5f5bbfdeca?a=1669&amp;region=&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg\" alt=\"Kundala dam\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/2f521641-798c-4965-bd4d-cd5f1290cefd?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=\" alt=\"Vattavada\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/e642751b-b8ae-4c96-8f0e-d0353224b1ec?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p><hr /><p>On 28 September 2025, i went to subash bose park with <a href=\"https://b3nsh4.com/\">ben</a></p><p>I brought some dryfruits for the home, talked a lot about various things in life.</p><p>We sat down in the park, talked about tech, linux &amp; life so far, did some deep thinking, thought about my life so far, and clicked some photos, and came back to flat.<img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/e1ef4630-c4b1-46a3-a26e-affb5ba534d8?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Subash bose park night\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/838d7565-7380-426d-97b6-3864d0abef6b?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Subhash bose park evening\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/c37faffe-b8cb-4740-9551-22749c6f7ca0?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Subhash bose park night 2\" /></p><p>After this day i had mental breakdown kinda, i can’t share it because of some personal reasons, but it was terrible, i felt like i was used emotionally, And being ignored afterwards, I felt like i lost myself, the things that were once fun for me. those things no longer gave me any kind of joy, i used to do so many things like playing games, cooking &amp; eating food of my choice, listening to music &amp; podcasts etc. But none of these things were giving me any kind joy or satisfaction, i was overthinking, exhausted, anxious and my sleep was messed up entirely. I was in a terrible state of mind, but luckily it only lasted 2 weeks or something. So moving forward</p><p>On 11th Oct, took a flight to delhi, Spent some time with family, celebrated dewali &amp; visited my sisters. Met two of my close school friends, but enjoyed a lot.My inner peace returned, i started enjoying things slowly. And i cameback to kochi on 16th Nov. Things were normal from now on, I was back with a mature emotional mind. Until after sometime i started doing the same overthinking, but this time it was not that bad i would say. Anyhow, moving on<img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/b76eabac-e505-4cf2-985a-b7c86193c3b2?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"9pm at our village\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/45857d5a-38de-4cbe-9ffa-126fe27089cf?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"GT road near ganaur, haryana\" /></p><hr /><p>On 22 December, We went to <a href=\"https://www.keralatourism.org/destination/kuzhupilly-beach-vypin-island/544/\">kuzhupilly</a> with our office team, i went to the beach, brought ticket for floating bridge, visited that, after that i sat down on the beach, There was a school kid, who was standing near me. I started talking to him, and we talked about cricket, studies, language etc.</p><p>After that i left the beach &amp; walked back to my place, Clicked a few photos along the way. Attended the christmas party, had a few drinks for energy, danced for a few seconds (cause yk i’m an introvert), went to the pool, tried swimming but failed, had a lot of fun in the pool, after that i took a shower, had dinner, slept, woke up next day, packed my bags, &amp; came back to flat.<img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/a8d79da4-4094-45e2-b6ae-01b13b0ebd15?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"Kuzhupilly beach\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/8dc979f0-584f-4de5-a0a0-48e7c067ad5c?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"our stay, kings holiday\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://files.horizon.pics/f7e9392c-8059-4271-aaed-85b296aa3ac8?a=1669&amp;mime1=image&amp;mime2=jpeg&amp;region=eu-central\" alt=\"View from our stay\" /></p><p>And i think that’s was it, mostly, I’ve written about major events happened in my life this year.

            "content_text": "Step 1: Identify Where It’s Happening  The first step is to figure out where the memory issue is occurring.  It could be due to anything, e.g. an internal library, queues, or your own code.Here’s what I did:  Add logs everywhere to track the flow of function calls.  Perform some potentially heavy actions (e.g., processing large amounts of data). In my case, it was report generation.  If you still haven’t found the action causing the memory leak, look elsewhere:          Check production logs and metrics.      Observe the timeline for when memory usage spikes.        Repeat this process until you’ve pin pointed the action that causes the memory leak or server crash. Then move to Step 2.Step 2: Track Function Calls and Memory Usage  Once you’ve found the problematic action, trace the function calls involved.  Add more logging and monitor memory usage closely.          You can log memory stats to a file along with timestamps.        Document the steps needed to reproduce the issue consistently.Step 3: Inspect further  Check if you’re adding too many items to arrays. If so, consider using batching or chunking to avoid (OOM) errors.  Inspect any streams or buffers in use.  Review filesystem related operations (e.g., fs.read, fs.write) to ensure they’re being used correctly.  Take note of idle memory usage (when OOM is not happening) for comparison.Step 4: Optimize the Root Cause  At this point, you’ve narrowed the issue down to a specific function or section of code. Now it’s time to optimize it.  Optimization is usually subjective and comes with trade offs.          Discuss with your team to find a good balance between memory usage and performance.      In my case, the culprit was SheetJS, which caused memory leaks when reading a huge file. I replaced it with ExcelJS using streaming writes. I also implemented an async generator function to further reduce memory usage while reading a large the JSONL file, which i use to generate the report.Most of your time will likely be spent on debugging. Once the issue is found and reliably reproducible, resolving it becomes much easier.That’s it for this one!Thanks for reading, and happy debugging! 😊",

Yes, of course. But that’s not the point. Junior devs aren’t hired because the task is impossible to do with AI. They’re hired for a very simple reason and that is called time.Team A can build a big project with or without the junior dev, but with a junior dev on the team, they can build it a bit faster as they can simply parallelize the work accordingly.Although the dev will follow whatever instructions are given and some back-and-forth communication will be required, the process is still more efficient.Giving the same task to AI might seem faster, but it requires prompting, proofreading the code, running it, and verifying the output.This consumes a significant amount of a senior developer’s time—which shouldn’t be wasted on mundane tasks. Sure, senior devs assist juniors, but replacing a junior dev would mean not utilizing a senior dev’s time optimally.Here’s a small analogy to illustrate my point:      It takes 2 people with 2 shovels 1 hour to dig a 3-foot hole.        Now comes a crane, which can do the same in 5 minutes—but it also requires a crane operator, a specialist.  The crane saves time, but can be expensive depending on where you live. More importantly, it might not be feasible to use a crane for small holes.This is similar to the junior-senior dev relationship. A junior dev handles small tasks to learn and understand the system, while a senior dev builds and maintains &amp; refines the system to ensure smooth operations of the system.At the end of the day, AI is just a tool that requires specialists to use it optimally. Otherwise, it can lead to disastrous bugs and poor user experiences.There’s a saying in hindi:“Bandar ke haath mein bandook dena”Which translates to giving a gun to a monkey. Monkeys can surely shoot, but it’ll be inaccurate and possibly harmful to themselves and those nearby.By monkeys, I mean non technical folks who try to do technical stuff with AIBy people I mean the users using on the software built by these monkeysAI is a perfect companion for everyone, and all the productivity claims are valid but only for simple tasks that don’t require deep knowledge or expertise.When it comes to anything that requires deep knowledge and problem-solving, AI fails horribly. Deep thinking is still something only humans are capable of. As of now atleast in April 2025Most of the time, we don’t even know what we want, so explaining it clearly is hard itself, Let alone crafting a good prompt and expecting AI to generate something useful without clear input is not yet possible.That’s it for today.

But turns out it was mDNS.Meet mDNS,Which stands for multicast DNS(Domain Name Server), and it requires zero configuration uses UDP multicast*.It’s already implemented in the operating systems like mac and linux and also in windows 10 and onwardsOn mac you can just goto settings &gt; sharingAnd you will find your hostname.Copy that hostname and Run a http server on your mac and bind it 0.0.0.0 so that anyone can access that your server in your local network.Now goto your other computer and goto browser and type: hostname.local:portMy case it was rolex.local:3000 and now you can access your web server which specifying the ip address your device. And it will work regardless your currently assigned IP as long as you’re on the same network.Refs:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNShttps://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html",

            "content_text": "Starting with work as usual, this year was quite more hectic when compared to last. The main reason for that is not actually work - it’s the other things that I need to take care of now, e.g., cooking breakfast and dinner, cleaning the room and utensils, and washing clothes. These chores take time, especially if you haven’t done any of these before.As for actual work, it was quite good actually. I found out that many people need help just like you; nobody knows everything, hence some things are blurry and there are trade-offs each time you make a decision. I remember a concept called the Production Possibility Curve which is taught in economics class. Now that I’ve experienced that in real life, I can fairly say that nothing’s perfect - there’s always room for improvement.This year my daily routine went like this:8:30 AM - Wake upShowerCook breakfastEat breakfast10:10 AM - Leave for workWork till 2:00 PMGo out for lunch with office buddies(Mostly CUSAT restaurant nowadays, but previously:Aaryas, Aamaram, Ella, Just Tiffins)Work till 7:00 PMCome back to apartmentChange clothesCook dinnerTalk to momBrowse social mediaSleep at 12:00 AMAnd that’s it for work days.For Sundays: except for work, I need to do laundry and room cleaning, and cook lunch as well.Once in two months or so, I visit my friend Ben. We usually discuss Linux, life, and a whole bunch of nerdy things.In July, we went to Munnar, which was my first office trip and it went really well, especially the Kokumalai Peak. The only issue was I didn’t know how to enjoy a trip, but now I know. It was a 3-day trip, and even though it is closer to Kochi, the environment changes drastically - coastal to mountain peaks and rain forests. I really liked the weather, clouds, and sky; it was overall an awesome experience. But as we reached our last day of the trip, we were all exhausted. If I remember correctly, I spent one hour in the shower after reaching back to the apartment, and I guess I slept for more than 10 hours.Fast forward to November:We had another office trip, and this time it was Kashmir.Day One: Starting from srinagar airport, We visited Nishat Garden, Shalimar Garden, Dal Lake.Day Two: We went to Sonamarg, and it wasn’t really a good experience because I don’t like horses. It was a horse ride for about 8 kms, and I stopped midway and started walking instead. Anyhow, it wasn’t that good of an experience - horse droppings everywhere and it was hella dusty there.Day Three: We went to Pahalgam. Again, horse ride, but this time it was okayish. I didn’t like it (the horse ride), but the place was good. Clicked a few photos, ate some Maggi, and walked around.Day Four: Gulmarg. This time it was a cable car ride, which I liked, but there was quite a rush there and we had to wait for 1.5 hours in queue just to come back down. There were horses again, but my friend and I skipped and chose to walk instead, and it was really fun.Day Five: Doodpathri. Horses again, but all of us skipped this time. We chose to walk instead, and it was again an awesome but exhausting experience. Clicked a few photos, observed the landscape - good experience and not much crowded either.Overall I liked Munnar over Kashmir because Kashmir felt somewhat familiar and similar to my hometown, which is North Delhi. Typical “grass is greener on the other side” situation, and the other side for me is Munnar and Kochi itself.Back to personal growth and achievements:I started going out to meetups, mainly Kochi FOSS.It is a wonderful experience talking to like-minded people.I started talking to people on the bus and at the bus stand. Even though I don’t understand much Malayalam, I can understand the context and answer other people’s general queries like bus timings, bus stop names etc.I’ve made a few new friends, mainly two people whom I talk with when we meet:Ambraj, Software Tester: little older than me but a experienced dude with a chill attitude. We explored Fort Kochi together. Recently had a few drinks with him. He’s my neighbor as well.The whole team at perfviz.com and ofcourse our astral boys of helloastral.com !And a few more folks whom I can’t remember now, but I talk to them whenever we catch up.Skills I learned this year:  Cooking  RemixJS  PostgreSQL DB internals  Debugging memory leaks  Golang basics  Communication improved significantly thanks to work from office  Socializing with people (even with not-so-like-minded folks who are not in from your domain)  Handling work-life balanceFinancially, it’s not that good because now I have bills to pay, i.e., rent for the apartment and buying groceries to cook and eat food. And since I have only received a very minor raise at the beginning of this year, I guess this year paid off majorly in terms of experience only.Work from home is still far cheaper than work from office for both the company and individual working in the company. Then again, I was living in my parents home from past 23 years so i guess it was very wise decision to move out explore the world outside.Anyhow, here are some fun facts for this year:  I flew 7 times this year.  I watched two movies in the theatre. (I don’t watch that much movies in theatre, so two is a big number for me lols)  I walked 16,000 steps in a day once (while in Kashmir)  I played games on My “Linux” laptop (Doom 3 and Insurgency 2014)  My average screen time went down significantly this year due to real-life interactions.And’s that’s almost it for this year.Thank you for reading &amp; Happy new year!",

            "content_text": "LifeIt’s been 3 months since i moved to kochi, kerela and i’m not missing much here, thanks to the awesome super hot weather &amp; suburban vibes of kakkanad district, I live very close to the infopark.If you like tech &amp; like minded people then this is place, Here almost everybody is working in IT domain.I share same building with 4 other tenants and All of them are developers, except one guy who once was a developer too but now into management (of developers ofc.)There are just so many developers &amp; so many people to learn from. During my first few days here, i met so many new devs (in person) which i don’t think i could ever imagine back when i was working remotely, So many great people living &amp; working here.Also people are very grounded &amp; humble as compared to delhi (Generally speaking although it depends from person to person, but overall i think this is comparatively better than delhi). So far never faced any issues while talking to people and asking for help.Almost everyone here understands english &amp; can talk to you in english, if you get lost anywhere just ask any young person near you and they’ll guide you to your destination. P.S: Bro code works here as well.And people even understand hindi and can speak broken hindi, this surprised me because i as a north indian can’t understood a single word of malayalam because the reason is that i was totally unaware of culture of this place and as it’s way too far from delhi (more than 2000 kms).FoodI really like the food here, its the perfect match for me when it comes to spices &amp; cooking, They just cook till the perfection point, nothing more &amp; nothing less, just perfect.They just use the right amount of spices &amp; oils. It’s never too spicy like we have in delhi, So it’s great for stomach, And so far never felt acidic or indigestion after eating from outside so far.My current favourite is dosa, masala dosa to be specific. There are many varieties of dosa here like plain dosa, podi dosa, ghee roast dosa, cheese masala dosa. And all of them are served with 3 types of coconut chutneys (orange - spicy &amp; tangy, white - coconutty if that’s word, green - mint &amp; coconut) &amp; sambar curry.And my second favourite idly which i’ve only tried two times, because it is mostly available for breakfast and i have a old habit of eating breakfast so mostly its gone by time the i reach restaurant.And my third favourite is rice meals, which consists of boiled rice, 3-4 types of side curries, 1 main curry (usually sambar or rasam), a papadam, some curd, and some optional pickles and payasam which is dessert pudding and to be eaten after finishing the meal.Also these only few of the dishes which i mentioned for vegetarians, if you’re a non-vegetarian then you have a endless variety of seafood &amp; meats they have everything here plus tons of restaurants serving arabian food.Though if you’re from north like me then you’ll probably miss authentic north indian food. They do serve good north indian food and its tasty as well but you’ll miss the punch of extra spiciness which is present in common north indian dishes like chole &amp; rajma.My current goto restaurant is “Just Tiffins” which is located near kakkanad junction, For north indian cuisines i think they are best for pure veg north indian food.Lastly you gotta eat with your one hand which is norm here actually.CinemaIts small (when compared to bollywood) and filled talented actors &amp; directors &amp; script writers, So far i’ve watched only one full length movie in theatre which is Bramayugam.And it was a good experience because it was black &amp; white, had very less dialogs which is good cause there were no subtitles. But i like indie stuff a bit more so i was looking for “malayalam short films with english subtitles”.Heres few which i’ve watched &amp; liked:  Cheryl  Life on the rocks  New normalTo be honest i want this post to be little bit more longer but this post was in draft since few weeks. So i’m just putting this out here before it gets too old.Thanks for reading!",

And all of them are served with 3 types of coconut chutneys (orange - spicy &amp; tangy, white - coconutty if that’s word, green - mint &amp; coconut) &amp; sambar curry.</p><p>And my second favourite idly which i’ve only tried two times, because it is mostly available for breakfast and i have a old habit of eating breakfast so mostly its gone by time the i reach restaurant.</p><p>And my third favourite is rice meals, which consists of boiled rice, 3-4 types of side curries, 1 main curry (usually sambar or rasam), a papadam, some curd, and some optional pickles and payasam which is dessert pudding and to be eaten after finishing the meal.</p><p>Also these only few of the dishes which i mentioned for vegetarians, if you’re a non-vegetarian then you have a endless variety of seafood &amp; meats they have everything here plus tons of restaurants serving arabian food.</p><p>Though if you’re from north like me then you’ll probably miss authentic north indian food. They do serve good north indian food and its tasty as well but you’ll miss the punch of extra spiciness which is present in common north indian dishes like chole &amp; rajma.</p><p>My current goto restaurant is “Just Tiffins” which is located near kakkanad junction, For north indian cuisines i think they are best for pure veg north indian food.</p><p>Lastly you gotta eat with your one hand which is norm here actually.</p><p><br /></p><h1 id=\"cinema\">Cinema</h1><p>Its small (when compared to bollywood) and filled talented actors &amp; directors &amp; script writers, So far i’ve watched only one full length movie in theatre which is Bramayugam.</p><p>And it was a good experience because it was black &amp; white, had very less dialogs which is good cause there were no subtitles. But i like indie stuff a bit more so i was looking for “malayalam short films with english subtitles”.</p><p>Heres few which i’ve watched &amp; liked:</p><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEnZ1kBWoIk&amp;t=22s\">Cheryl</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMM4r6Hle7g\">Life on the rocks</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_VGS7lGF64\">New normal</a></li></ul><p>To be honest i want this post to be little bit more longer but this post was in draft since few weeks. So i’m just putting this out here before it gets too old.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>",

This year i was able to master nestjs &amp; prisma &amp; react &amp; went dive enough that i can figure out things on my own if enough time is given to me.And now i also occaisonally go in source code of the libs to figure out how things are working behind fancy methods that a lib provides. Like last month i went a bit deep in shopify api js lib to figure out a server crash which was happening when using shopify api js lib for sessions turns out it was a lack of try catch block in our middleware.And speaking of communication skills, i think i improved a lot. Now i can handle a meeting as a host for 4 teammates (including me), And previously i used to get frozen few times &amp; mind goes blank when explaining a idea or a problem in front of my teammates. But now i also use a hack, which is to take notes before (if your the host) and after any meeting. And also i can help my teammates in debugging &amp; brainstorming ideas and problems when needed by pairing via slack huddle or gmeet.And one skill which i learned from handling customer support is to make reasonable yet ambigious promises for feature requests &amp; bugfixes, from a developer prespective we never know how much time somethinig will take, so we ask for atleast 2 days even if the work is about 2 hours cause the code change needs to go through these phases, starting from the code review &gt; manual testing &gt; approval (if everything is ok) &gt; staging (last manual test) finally release if everything is alright &amp; monitoring the server &amp; informing the client. And these things take time as usual so we need take this time into consideration.Speaking to clients on call, like 99.9% users are generally very good &amp; polite and dealing with them is easy for me. But Dealing with 0.1% is a bit daunting for me so i let my senior to deal with them.All in all this year was turned out to be pretty great for me. We developed &amp; launched around 4 apps which is not many but we explored other horizons too.Personal LifeOne goal of mine was to focus on fitness, which i missed it entirely this year.And also the diet even though i follow a strict vegetarian diet but i ate quite less this year, compared to last year. The reason for this is possibly due to my habit of sitting too long &amp; not taking enough breaks while working, and this resulted in lack of appetite.So for the next year i’ll be focusing on regular excercising &amp; try to put on atleast some amount of muscle.And also one thing which i’m doing from past 2 years is to nightwalk and this year I was fairly consistent and walked for 4Kms or 5k steps almost daily. Here are some of pics i clicked this year:(01/07/2023, 09:29 pm) A chill night in smoking hot weather of delhi with AQI less than 100 &amp; cold breeze flowing through paddy fields, one of the best day of year 2023(18/12/2023, 08:40pm) A cold night &amp; a empty road with good AQI, few dogs walking with us after dinner.Learnings this year (personal)  Understanding power dynamics in family relations &amp; making sure that no one will take any advantage of me.  Keeping distance from toxic people and not letting interfere with my life decisions.  Not chasing desires &amp; people, desires come &amp; go and same with people, and i don’t try to chase them, and i try to go with the flow.  Understanding my responsiblities &amp; trying to reduce them gradually.These were the few of major points which i learned this year,And there are few things which i’ve done first time in my life:  Travelling to bikaner (450kms) via train  Walking 20k steps in one day, (was attending &amp; assisting in a wedding ceremony)  Buying shoes for myself (lols i don’t like wearing shoes but i brought &amp; wore them because of wedding ceremony)Thank you very much for reading till the end.

Some common ones are you might have used is maybe chrome://flags/ and and maybe also developers settings in android smartphonesHere’s a real-world scenario:At StoreTools, we recently released a new feature that allows us to restrict the maximum number of orders a user can print based on their subscribed plan. However, after the release, we discovered that many merchants were already exceeding their plan’s order limit. The main issue arose from the fact that we were displaying an error in JSON format, but we weren’t effectively parsing and presenting this error as a user-friendly banner.Consequently, several merchants contacted us, reporting the error they were facing. As a quick solution, we had to temporarily comment out the code responsible for enforcing the order limit. This process, including deployment, took us around 30 minutes.This situation could have been optimized by utilizing feature flags. By implementing feature flags, we could have easily disabled the specific feature causing the issue.

Some common ones are you might have used is maybe <a href=\"chrome://flags/\">chrome://flags/</a> and and maybe also developers settings in android smartphones</p><h5 id=\"heres-a-real-world-scenario\">Here’s a real-world scenario:</h5><p>At StoreTools, we recently released a new feature that allows us to restrict the maximum number of orders a user can print based on their subscribed plan. However, after the release, we discovered that many merchants were already exceeding their plan’s order limit. The main issue arose from the fact that we were displaying an error in JSON format, but we weren’t effectively parsing and presenting this error as a user-friendly banner.</p><p>Consequently, several merchants contacted us, reporting the error they were facing. As a quick solution, we had to temporarily comment out the code responsible for enforcing the order limit. This process, including deployment, took us around 30 minutes.</p><p>This situation could have been optimized by utilizing feature flags. By implementing feature flags, we could have easily disabled the specific feature causing the issue. While I have not yet incorporated feature flags into a production environment in a proper manner, I believe that using them could have resolved this problem within a matter of seconds.s</p><ul>  <li>Read more about them:    <ul>      <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJa2B-twtG4\">IBM’s Video on Feature flags</a></li>      <li><a href=\"https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/\">Launch Darkly</a> a Saas providing products implementing feature flags in enterprises application</li>    </ul>  </li></ul>",

My web dev journey as started in late 2020 which you read more about it hereBefore joining storetools, i had some little experience as i completed my first book django 3 by example, it taught me MVC architecture , Databases, Basic request response cycle etc.  As well as django specific things like Django template language, Django ORM, Django admin panel, APIs with Django Rest Framework. And also i got some more experience as I did few freelance projects with Ben. We got to learn many things such as working on a legacy code of Django 2 version, Extending with out own ideas such as implementing online payments into a old Hostel management system. Working on chat application that we made in flask socketio &amp; websockets, that was my first intro to event driven programming.Also i used to learn web security in 2019, which taught me how to use browser dev tools, And also learned frontend from kevin powell &amp;  Traversy Media.Nowadays i work mostly with nestjs &amp; react &amp; as well as some liquid template, which are kind of same tech but just with javascript flavour this time instead of Python, I can speed things up for me like 2x because of past experiences with Programming. TLDR; Learning never goes to waste… unless ofcourse its ruby &amp; rails *Btw its just the starting, That is why i named this post as Connecting the dots (partially), i have plenty of things to learn &amp; utilize in future.

Working on chat application that we made in <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/\">flask</a> <a href=\"https://socket.io/\">socketio</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket\">websockets</a>, that was my first intro to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture\">event driven</a> programming.</p><p>Also i used to learn <a href=\"https://owasp.org/\">web security</a> in 2019, which taught me how to use browser dev tools, And also learned frontend from <a href=\"https://www.kevinpowell.co/\">kevin powell</a> &amp;  <a href=\"https://www.traversymedia.com/\">Traversy Media</a>.</p><p>Nowadays i work mostly with <a href=\"https://nestjs.com/\">nestjs</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">react</a> &amp; as well as some <a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\">liquid template</a>, which are kind of same tech but just with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\">javascript</a> flavour this time instead of <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a>, I can speed things up for me like 2x because of past experiences with Programming. TLDR; Learning never goes to waste… unless ofcourse its <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">ruby</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">rails</a> *</p><p>Btw its just the starting, That is why i named this post as Connecting the dots (partially), i have plenty of things to learn &amp; utilize in future. So let’s see how this goes.</p><p>Thanks for reading Bye Bye</p><p>* (just kidding i still have plenty of space in my heart for  <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">ruby</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">rails</a>)</p>",

And also probably would have caused speed issues due to lack of network coverage in my roon.But even with my phone sitting in between two laptops (and i mean technically &amp; literally both here) and bummer i got like 3-4 MB data transfer speed :( and not only that ii was fluctuating cause of number of files i was transferring about 10GBand an average about 3 MB per fileSo i left it on for a while &amp; slept for like 1 hrand i woke at 2:30pm i guess &amp; it was still in progress -_- anyhow i let it run, there’s also another issue with wireless transfer, when i turned on Bluetooth to connect my wireless earphones to my phone, And then speed suddenly went down to like 949 kbps -_-This was happening due to air traffic between 2.4 ghz wifi &amp; 2.4ghz Bluetooth using same frequency band.that was my situation i can’t even use my phone for anything &amp; laptops are already busy transferring data, If you remember i was using my phone as wifi hotspot, and both laptops were connected to it. There’s also one problem with it was my phone didn’t had any internet pack available, so i was completely offline for like 3 hrs straight &amp; without any entertainment lolsThat was probably why i fell asleep XDFast forward to 3:30pm after transfer was complete i messaged my friend ben, and i informed him about the situation i was struggling with and asked for alternatives.He sent a photo of LAN Cable, and said it will useful in these scenarios &amp; i asked few question about if we could connect two laptops directly without any switch or router, and he said yes, after a while I remembered my brother had one LAN cable, which came in the tenda router box. I went to upstairs for tea break, and got the cable.Connected the cable from old laptop to new laptop, And this was my first experience with a LAN Cable, I started searching the internet for sharing files with a lan cable, found some articlesdid the typical network &amp; file sharing setup in windows 10 &amp; did test transfer of like 10GBof my music collection, about roughly 2100+ audio filesand it just took less than 15mins.I got like 10MBps or 100mbps and this time it was almost consistent 10MBps, And also i was to able to use my Bluetooth earphones &amp; internet(wifi) freely.",

            "content_text": "Problems or (What &amp; Why?)??Why people are chasing success? What do they mean by success? is financial success is everything?  As of now in 2021's India Most people think success is getting a govt. job &amp; that's it!But I dont think so? is govt job is keep up to everything want in life? No, its just a secure jobwhile nothing is permanent in this world, they think are settled, but in real life, nobody gets settledafter getting, we gotta repeat same things almost daily, and repetition is equal to boredom.  From my perespective i think life is about balacing all aspects of human a beings' life,I mean keeping everything balanced from work life to social life, childhood to parenthood, physical health to mental health everything needs to balanced, While our education system only teachs about how to get a job, not how to live a life.  Anyways here are some problems that i faced/found in our current indian education system while i was studying commerce from school &amp;  college.Irrelevant subjects  Like Business &amp; Industerial Laws, Hindi Language. This subject must be relevant to Law/Hindi specialization students only.  However these subjects can be recommended &amp; but not mandatory to study (Optionally any one can look it up on internet, if they want to).Out of date syllabus/circicullum  In modern day society accounting is mostly done through computers. But they dont teach us about computers  They dont teach us about Book Keeping softwares like Busy, Tally etc.  &amp; Even Nowadays from manufacturing to selling products or services whether they are tangible or intangible.  Are Now being done with the help of computers, E.g. Product design using solidworks, IoT devices to Aid in manufacturing, Online selling through ecommerce platforms like Amazon, Digital Marketing with Google Adsense &amp; FacebookAds.  In simple words “Internet &amp; Computers” are missing or I would rahther say ignored by our so called “Indian Education System”.Grade system, to test student ablilities (Yikes),  Cause we never know how much a student knows about something without testing him/her in a real world scenario.  Discussions/Debate/Interviews/Internships are good way to test a students' abilities.Real world financial education  They teach us about how to manage company funds, not how to manage our own funds.  In simple words: how to maxmimize our income &amp; gains(investing), &amp; not how to minimize your expenses(savings)  Every student nowadays own a smartphone worth of atleast 20k &amp; they dont even use to its full potential  i.e. we can do content creation, digital marketing, programming, learn trading &amp; many other things all this for free. ,  but they do they do instead ? Gaming typically battle royale like PUBG or Free Fire.  Or Social Media a new drug in the market, We can see “busy students” outside every education institutes, Scrolling through their facebook, twitter, instagram etc.Result  Traditional teaching apporoach(Theortical) + Out of date syllabus + Irrelevant subjects = A piece of paper that is of no use &amp; a human with no particular skill in hand.Solutions(How???)  More real world subjects like digital marketing.  Book keeping using erp softwares like Busy.  Enterprise Resource Mangement using Odoo Erp or Dolibarr.  Official work using presentations, spreadsheets etc.  New Passion related subjects like  Music Production using Digital Audio Workstation, Also Writing Lyrics.  Video Production using DSLR Cameras &amp; Processing it using Adobe premeier. Also writing screenplay or jokes for standup comedians  Renewable energy using solar panels &amp; wind mills etc.  Game development using Unity.  Android app development using kotlin &amp; android sdk.  Architectural planning using AutoCAD &amp; Autodesk Revit.  Web security using OWASP study material &amp; Burpsuite.  (…Insert any topic with their real world applications)  Freedom for students to choose what they want to be in their life, regardless of their gender, grades, or whatever.  btw i didnt included any medical &amp; engineering topics as they are already too common in india.  Learn by doing is always the best apporoach to learn something!Conclusion(When???)  I think we should all focus on heading towards the solutions  But sadly we’re mostly still stuck in time,  All I see is youngsters here in my area are just preparing for laid back 9 to 1 govt jobs (&amp; yes most govt. clerks work from 9am to 1pm, or govt. teachers 8am to 2pm max)  This is happening often due to herd mentality (i.e. sheep follow sheep)  Anyways My belief is Everything is Learned a Skill.  Nobody is born with talent/Skill  but exceptions are always there ;)Thank you very much for reading till the end, Hope you have a great day. :)",
