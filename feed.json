During my first few days here, i met so many new devs (in person) which i don’t think i could ever imagine back when i was working remotely, So many great people living &amp; working here.Also people are very grounded &amp; humble as compared to delhi (Generally speaking although it depends from person to person, but overall i think this is comparatively better than delhi). So far never faced any issues while talking to people and asking for help.Almost everyone here understands english &amp; can talk to you in english, if you get lost anywhere just ask any young person near you and they’ll guide you to your destination. P.S: Bro code works here as well.And people even understand hindi and can speak broken hindi, this surprised me because i as a north indian can’t understood a single word of malayalam because the reason is that i was totally unaware of culture of this place and as it’s way too far from delhi (more than 2000 kms).FoodI really like the food here, its the perfect match for me when it comes to spices &amp; cooking, They just cook till the perfection point, nothing more &amp; nothing less, just perfect.They just use the right amount of spices &amp; oils. It’s never too spicy like we have in delhi, So it’s great for stomach, And so far never felt acidic or indigestion after eating from outside so far.My current favourite is dosa, masala dosa to be specific. There are many varieties of dosa here like plain dosa, podi dosa, ghee roast dosa, cheese masala dosa. And all of them are served with 3 types of coconut chutneys (orange - spicy &amp; tangy, white - coconutty if that’s word, green - mint &amp; coconut) &amp; sambar curry.And my second favourite idly which i’ve only tried two times, because it is mostly available for breakfast and i have a old habit of eating breakfast so mostly its gone by time the i reach restaurant.And my third favourite is rice meals, which consists of boiled rice, 3-4 types of side curries, 1 main curry (usually sambar or rasam), a papadam, some curd, and some optional pickles and payasam which is dessert pudding and to be eaten after finishing the meal.Also these only few of the dishes which i mentioned for vegetarians, if you’re a non-vegetarian then you have a endless variety of seafood &amp; meats they have everything here plus tons of restaurants serving arabian food.Though if you’re from north like me then you’ll probably miss authentic north indian food. They do serve good north indian food and its tasty as well but you’ll miss the punch of extra spiciness which is present in common north indian dishes like chole &amp; rajma.My current goto restaurant is “Just Tiffins” which is located near kakkanad junction, For north indian cuisines i think they are best for pure veg north indian food.Lastly you gotta eat with your one hand which is norm here actually.CinemaIts small (when compared to bollywood) and filled talented actors &amp; directors &amp; script writers, So far i’ve watched only one full length movie in theatre which is Bramayugam.And it was a good experience because it was black &amp; white, had very less dialogs which is good cause there were no subtitles. But i like indie stuff a bit more so i was looking for “malayalam short films with english subtitles”.Heres few which i’ve watched &amp; liked:  Cheryl  Life on the rocks  New normalTo be honest i want this post to be little bit more longer but this post was in draft since few weeks. So i’m just putting this out here before it gets too old.Thanks for reading!",

This year i was able to master nestjs &amp; prisma &amp; react &amp; went dive enough that i can figure out things on my own if enough time is given to me.And now i also occaisonally go in source code of the libs to figure out how things are working behind fancy methods that a lib provides. Like last month i went a bit deep in shopify api js lib to figure out a server crash which was happening when using shopify api js lib for sessions turns out it was a lack of try catch block in our middleware.And speaking of communication skills, i think i improved a lot. Now i can handle a meeting as a host for 4 teammates (including me), And previously i used to get frozen few times &amp; mind goes blank when explaining a idea or a problem in front of my teammates. But now i also use a hack, which is to take notes before (if your the host) and after any meeting. And also i can help my teammates in debugging &amp; brainstorming ideas and problems when needed by pairing via slack huddle or gmeet.And one skill which i learned from handling customer support is to make reasonable yet ambigious promises for feature requests &amp; bugfixes, from a developer prespective we never know how much time somethinig will take, so we ask for atleast 2 days even if the work is about 2 hours cause the code change needs to go through these phases, starting from the code review &gt; manual testing &gt; approval (if everything is ok) &gt; staging (last manual test) finally release if everything is alright &amp; monitoring the server &amp; informing the client. And these things take time as usual so we need take this time into consideration.Speaking to clients on call, like 99.9% users are generally very good &amp; polite and dealing with them is easy for me. But Dealing with 0.1% is a bit daunting for me so i let my senior to deal with them.All in all this year was turned out to be pretty great for me. We developed &amp; launched around 4 apps which is not many but we explored other horizons too.Personal LifeOne goal of mine was to focus on fitness, which i missed it entirely this year.And also the diet even though i follow a strict vegetarian diet but i ate quite less this year, compared to last year. The reason for this is possibly due to my habit of sitting too long &amp; not taking enough breaks while working, and this resulted in lack of appetite.So for the next year i’ll be focusing on regular excercising &amp; try to put on atleast some amount of muscle.And also one thing which i’m doing from past 2 years is to nightwalk and this year I was fairly consistent and walked for 4Kms or 5k steps almost daily. Here are some of pics i clicked this year:(01/07/2023, 09:29 pm) A chill night in smoking hot weather of delhi with AQI less than 100 &amp; cold breeze flowing through paddy fields, one of the best day of year 2023(18/12/2023, 08:40pm) A cold night &amp; a empty road with good AQI, few dogs walking with us after dinner.Learnings this year (personal)  Understanding power dynamics in family relations &amp; making sure that no one will take any advantage of me.  Keeping distance from toxic people and not letting interfere with my life decisions.  Not chasing desires &amp; people, desires come &amp; go and same with people, and i don’t try to chase them, and i try to go with the flow.  Understanding my responsiblities &amp; trying to reduce them gradually.These were the few of major points which i learned this year,And there are few things which i’ve done first time in my life:  Travelling to bikaner (450kms) via train  Walking 20k steps in one day, (was attending &amp; assisting in a wedding ceremony)  Buying shoes for myself (lols i don’t like wearing shoes but i brought &amp; wore them because of wedding ceremony)Thank you very much for reading till the end.

            "summary": "Dumping Prisma in favour of kysely",
            "content_text": "BackstoryI recently got assigned a ticket to implement kysely sql query builder in a production app, as prisma was hitting our Pg instance way too much than it should, which is why our Pg instance is using more than 15GB ram.Though, our usecase is very read &amp; write heavy,so that’s why we’re switching to kysely that too partially, cause a full shift to kysely will take about a month or more than that.But never jump on the hype train, always consider your usecase first.Important Notes      if this is your first using a sql query builder* then it will be a bit hard to digest at first, for me its been a week since i’m dealing with kysely and sql query builders in general, and please consider my advice as a grain of salt. (* not to confuse with an orm. query builders are like sql written in a functional programming fashion which is also called a builder pattern, or method chaining.)        You’ll be writing sql in js, and if you’re like me who is well proficient in prisma but a dumbo in raw sql, than trust me its hard man, you’ll be plucking eyelids hairs in no time.(though i’ll add some handy queries at end of this post)        chatgpt does not know anything about kysely, but you can ask it for knex query builder &amp; since kysely is loosely inspired from it, you can take the code from there and apply accordingly to the docs of kysely, (which are kind of incomplete tbh).        Be extra careful, if your data is having datetime data like createdAt and updatedAt datetime fields.  Prisma does some black magic fuckery to converts your timestamps to utc, and kysely is barebones so you need to use a lib like dayjs to convert your datetime to utc.TutorialSo, start by installing kysely &amp; kysely-codegenkysely-codegen will inspect your existing database &amp; generate a file with types based upon table structures in db.Now after generating types, create a dir. inside src of server workspace and name whatever you like, i’ll be using kysely-orm and create few files &amp; dir:  migrations          initial-migration.ts        migrator.ts  schema.b.ts(copy the generated types from kysely-codegen dir &amp; paste it here.)  initial-migration.tsimport { Kysely, sql } from \"kysely\";export async function up(db: Kysely&lt;any&gt;): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  console.log(\"Creatng table Order\");  await db.schema    .createTable(\"Order\")    .addColumn(\"shop\", \"varchar\")    .addColumn(\"id\", \"varchar\", (col) =&gt; col.primaryKey())    .addColumn(\"orderId\", \"varchar\", (col) =&gt; col.unique())    .addColumn(\"orderNumber\", \"varchar\")    .addColumn(\"createdAt\", \"timestamp\", (col) =&gt; col.defaultTo(sql`now()`))    .addColumn(\"updatedAt\", \"timestamp\")    .addColumn(\"orderJSON\", \"json\")    .execute();  console.log(\"Creatng table Refund\");  await db.schema    .createTable(\"Refund\")    .addColumn(\"id\", \"varchar\", (col) =&gt; col.primaryKey())    .addColumn(\"refundId\", \"varchar\", (col) =&gt; col.unique())    .addColumn(\"orderId\", \"varchar\", (col) =&gt;      col.references(\"Order.id\").onDelete(\"cascade\")    )    .addColumn(\"shop\", \"varchar\")    .addColumn(\"createdAt\", \"timestamp\")    .execute();}export async function down(db: Kysely&lt;any&gt;): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  await db.schema.dropTable(\"Order\").execute();  await db.schema.dropTable(\"Refund\").execute();}  migrator.tsimport { Migrator } from \"kysely\";export async function migrateToLatest(migrator: Migrator) {  const { error, results } = await migrator.migrateToLatest();  if (results.length &gt; 0) {    console.log(\"RESULT: \", results);  }  if (error) {    console.error(\"ERROR: \", error);  }  results?.forEach((it) =&gt; {    if (it.status === \"Success\") {      console.log(`migration \"${it.migrationName}\" was executed successfully`);    } else if (it.status === \"Error\") {      console.error(`failed to execute migration \"${it.migrationName}\"`);    }  });  if (error) {    console.error(\"failed to migrate\");    console.error(error);    process.exit(1);  }}  schema.b.tsimport type { ColumnType } from \"kysely\";export type Generated&lt;T&gt; = T extends ColumnType&lt;infer S, infer I, infer U&gt;  ?

            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"backstory\">Backstory</h2><p>I recently got assigned a ticket to implement kysely sql query builder in a production app, as prisma was hitting our Pg instance way too much than it should, which is why our Pg instance is using more than 15GB ram.</p><p>Though, our usecase is very read &amp; write heavy,so that’s why we’re switching to kysely that too partially, cause a full shift to kysely will take about a month or more than that.</p><p>But never jump on the hype train, always consider your usecase first.</p><h3 id=\"important-notes\">Important Notes</h3><ol>  <li>    <p>if this is your first using a sql query builder* then it will be a bit hard to digest at first, for me its been a week since i’m dealing with kysely and sql query builders in general, and please consider my advice as a grain of salt. (* not to confuse with an orm. query builders are like sql written in a functional programming fashion which is also called a builder pattern, or method chaining.)</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>You’ll be writing sql in js, and if you’re like me who is well proficient in prisma but a dumbo in raw sql, than trust me its hard man, you’ll be plucking eyelids hairs in no time.(though i’ll add some handy queries at end of this post)</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>chatgpt does not know anything about kysely, but you can ask it for knex query builder &amp; since kysely is loosely inspired from it, you can take the code from there and apply accordingly to the docs of kysely, (which are kind of incomplete tbh).</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Be extra careful, if your data is having datetime data like createdAt and updatedAt datetime fields.</p>  </li></ol><p>Prisma does some black magic fuckery to converts your timestamps to utc, and kysely is barebones so you need to use a lib like dayjs to convert your datetime to utc.</p><h3 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h3><p>So, start by installing <a href=\"https://kysely.dev/docs/getting-started\">kysely</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen\">kysely-codegen</a></p><p>kysely-codegen will inspect your existing database &amp; generate a file with types based upon table structures in

create few files &amp; dir:</p><ul>  <li>migrations    <ul>      <li>initial-migration.ts</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>migrator.ts</li>  <li>schema.b.ts(copy the generated types from kysely-codegen dir

I’ve made plans for it way back in August i believe,i never liked windows, but had to use it because it wasn’t my own laptop, I broughtthis new mid range machine that is acer aspire 7i5 12th gen(1240p) 12 cores, 16 threads, 4.4ghz max turbo (Well enough for most use cases)8GB Ram (enough for linux, very low for windows 11 especially if you work with VMs/WSL)512GB (pcie gen 4 nvme SSD, good for me, cause i only hoard m4a &amp; mp3s music files.)NVIDIA GTX1650 (good entry level gpu, but i dont do gaming lols)So how was the experience?it wasn’t great at first, cause i initially broke my first linux mint installation because of nvidia drivers :(now, i’m running without nvidia drivers, and its working pretty fine thanks to xfce.Why linux mint?I dont really like distro hopping, i needed something stable, cause i use this laptop as my personal laptop.After a bit of research i found linux mint to beginner friendly as well as easy to install &amp; configure.Fast forward -»&gt;Linux mint cinnamon was laggy atleast for me, i dont know why.even youtube playback for 720p video dropped frames a lot.Did some googling can’t find anything useful, so i decided to switch to xfce DEconfigured xfce-panel, whisker menu, installed &amp; configured xfce goodies etc.This took me while like 4-5 hoursi mainly had experience with linux commandline, thanks to termux &amp; arch armbefore this i’ve only tried like 2 two times, that is once in virtual box &amp; once in native machinedidn’t really liked the experience with VMs which is due to my old low spec laptopm (i have HP notebook from 2016, i3 5th, 4Gb ram, 1TB HDD).But when it comes to commandline on windows, i never liked powershell for node or python devlopment cause i really hate theirlack of auto-completion &amp; very long commands to do simple things like opening up a port &amp; bypassing the firewall for incoming connections etc. I always liked linux cli with zsh &amp; tmux, its ultimate combo if you’re a power user/developer.some annoying things are linux i found/ not figured out yet!are as follows:  weird theming with chrome(probably caused by GTK)  inconsistent font size (maybe caused by misconfiguration from my side)  scaling (XFCE bug/feature) only 1, or 2 not like 1.25 etc  xfce terminal* (took 5 hours to replicate my setup from wsl2 ubuntu &amp; windows terminal)  Bluetooth GUI was not showing my dell mouse, but bluectl found it, still connects &amp; disconnects like every 2s.  webcam is not working!!!! thanks to acer &amp; no drivers for it in linux  mouse wheel scroll is very slow, third party stuff makes it worse (lookin at you imwheel)  Way too much time taking to configure all these things.i’m a perfectionist (kinda) and i think my machine is now close to perfection (atleast for me)i can bear the pain for small things to get some freedom from windows 11.Btw really proud of xfce terminal &amp; i configured it with these features:  select to copy  crtl + v to paste  tmux mouse support  unicode support  cmus  cava  lsd, bat, git-delta  oh my zsh (can’t live without this one!)btw replicating the same setup on macOS is way easier then linux. Because community &amp; consistency of macOSthings are stable &amp; preconfigured in macOS, mostly its just download application &amp; run it (in a nutshell it works.

I’ve made plans for it way back in August i believe,i never liked windows, but had to use it because it wasn’t my own laptop, I broughtthis new mid range machine that is acer aspire 7i5 12th gen(1240p) 12 cores, 16 threads, 4.4ghz max turbo (Well enough for most use cases)8GB Ram (enough for linux, very low for windows 11 especially if you work with VMs/WSL)512GB (pcie gen 4 nvme SSD, good for me, cause i only hoard m4a &amp; mp3s music files.)NVIDIA GTX1650 (good entry level gpu, but i dont do gaming lols)</p><h5 id=\"so-how-was-the-experience\">So how was the experience?</h5><p>it wasn’t great at first, cause i initially broke my first linux mint installation because of nvidia drivers :(now, i’m running without nvidia drivers, and its working pretty fine thanks to xfce.</p><h5 id=\"why-linux-mint\">Why linux mint?</h5><p>I dont really like distro hopping, i needed something stable, cause i use this laptop as my personal laptop.After a bit of research i found linux mint to beginner friendly as well as easy to install &amp; configure.</p><p>Fast forward -»&gt;Linux mint cinnamon was laggy atleast for me, i dont know why.even youtube playback for 720p video dropped frames a lot.Did some googling can’t find anything useful, so i decided to switch to xfce DEconfigured xfce-panel, whisker menu, installed &amp; configured xfce goodies etc.This took me while like 4-5 hours</p><p>i mainly had experience with linux commandline, thanks to termux &amp; arch armbefore this i’ve only tried like 2 two times, that is once in virtual box &amp; once in native machinedidn’t really liked the experience with VMs which is due to my old low spec laptopm (i have HP notebook from 2016, i3 5th, 4Gb ram, 1TB HDD).</p><p>But when it comes to commandline on windows, i never liked powershell for node or python devlopment cause i really hate theirlack of auto-completion &amp; very long commands to do simple things like opening up a port &amp; bypassing the firewall for incoming connections etc. I always liked linux cli with zsh &amp; tmux, its ultimate combo if you’re a power user/developer.</p><p>some annoying things are linux i found/ not figured out yet!are as follows:</p><ul>  <li>weird theming with chrome(probably caused by GTK)</li>  <li>inconsistent font size (maybe caused by misconfiguration from my side)</li>  <li>scaling (XFCE bug/feature) only 1, or 2 not like 1.25 etc</li>  <li>xfce terminal* (took 5 hours to replicate my setup from wsl2 ubuntu &amp; windows terminal)</li>  <li>Bluetooth GUI was not showing my dell mouse, but bluectl found it, still connects &amp; disconnects like every 2s.</li>  <li>webcam is not working!!!! thanks to acer &amp; no drivers for it in linux</li>  <li>mouse wheel scroll is very slow, third party stuff makes it worse (lookin at you imwheel)</li>  <li>Way too much time taking to configure all these things.</li></ul><p>i’m a perfectionist (kinda) and i think my machine is now close to perfection (atleast for me)i can bear the pain for small things to get some freedom from windows 11.Btw really proud of xfce terminal &amp; i configured it with these features:</p><ul>  <li>select to copy</li>  <li>crtl + v to paste</li>  <li>tmux mouse support</li>  <li>unicode support</li>  <li>cmus</li>  <li>cava</li>  <li>lsd, bat, git-delta</li>  <li>oh my zsh (can’t live without this one!)</li></ul><p>btw replicating the same setup on macOS is way easier then linux. Because community &amp; consistency of macOSthings are stable &amp; preconfigured in macOS, mostly its just download application &amp; run it (in a nutshell it works. But man copy pasting &amp; selecting text is real pain in macOS thanks weird command key obbession).</p><h6 id=\"screenshots\">Screenshots</h6><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/rKcezq1.png\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/rKcezq1.png\" alt=\"https://imgur.com/rKcezq1.png\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/Cfh2pSl.png\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/Cfh2pSl.png\" alt=\"https://imgur.com/Cfh2pSl.png\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/xEeCl22.png\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/xEeCl22.png\" alt=\"https://imgur.com/xEeCl22.png\" /></a></p>",

And also probably would have caused speed issues due to lack of network coverage in my roon.But even with my phone sitting in between two laptops (and i mean technically &amp; literally both here) and bummer i got like 3-4 MB data transfer speed :( and not only that ii was fluctuating cause of number of files i was transferring about 10GBand an average about 3 MB per fileSo i left it on for a while &amp; slept for like 1 hrand i woke at 2:30pm i guess &amp; it was still in progress -_- anyhow i let it run, there’s also another issue with wireless transfer, when i turned on Bluetooth to connect my wireless earphones to my phone, And then speed suddenly went down to like 949 kbps -_-This was happening due to air traffic between 2.4 ghz wifi &amp; 2.4ghz Bluetooth using same frequency band.that was my situation i can’t even use my phone for anything &amp; laptops are already busy transferring data, If you remember i was using my phone as wifi hotspot, and both laptops were connected to it. There’s also one problem with it was my phone didn’t had any internet pack available, so i was completely offline for like 3 hrs straight &amp; without any entertainment lolsThat was probably why i fell asleep XDFast forward to 3:30pm after transfer was complete i messaged my friend ben, and i informed him about the situation i was struggling with and asked for alternatives.He sent a photo of LAN Cable, and said it will useful in these scenarios &amp; i asked few question about if we could connect two laptops directly without any switch or router, and he said yes, after a while I remembered my brother had one LAN cable, which came in the tenda router box. I went to upstairs for tea break, and got the cable.Connected the cable from old laptop to new laptop, And this was my first experience with a LAN Cable, I started searching the internet for sharing files with a lan cable, found some articlesdid the typical network &amp; file sharing setup in windows 10 &amp; did test transfer of like 10GBof my music collection, about roughly 2100+ audio filesand it just took less than 15mins.I got like 10MBps or 100mbps and this time it was almost consistent 10MBps, And also i was to able to use my Bluetooth earphones &amp; internet(wifi) freely.",

            "content_text": "Problems or (What &amp; Why?)??Why people are chasing success? What do they mean by success? is financial success is everything?  As of now in 2021's India Most people think success is getting a govt. job &amp; that's it!But I dont think so? is govt job is keep up to everything want in life? No, its just a secure jobwhile nothing is permanent in this world, they think are settled, but in real life, nobody gets settledafter getting, we gotta repeat same things almost daily, and repetition is equal to boredom.  From my perespective i think life is about balacing all aspects of human a beings' life,I mean keeping everything balanced from work life to social life, childhood to parenthood, physical health to mental health everything needs to balanced, While our education system only teachs about how to get a job, not how to live a life.  Anyways here are some problems that i faced/found in our current indian education system while i was studying commerce from school &amp;  college.Irrelevant subjects  Like Business &amp; Industerial Laws, Hindi Language. This subject must be relevant to Law/Hindi specialization students only.  However these subjects can be recommended &amp; but not mandatory to study (Optionally any one can look it up on internet, if they want to).Out of date syllabus/circicullum  In modern day society accounting is mostly done through computers. But they dont teach us about computers  They dont teach us about Book Keeping softwares like Busy, Tally etc.  &amp; Even Nowadays from manufacturing to selling products or services whether they are tangible or intangible.  Are Now being done with the help of computers, E.g. Product design using solidworks, IoT devices to Aid in manufacturing, Online selling through ecommerce platforms like Amazon, Digital Marketing with Google Adsense &amp; FacebookAds.  In simple words “Internet &amp; Computers” are missing or I would rahther say ignored by our so called “Indian Education System”.Grade system, to test student ablilities (Yikes),  Cause we never know how much a student knows about something without testing him/her in a real world scenario.  Discussions/Debate/Interviews/Internships are good way to test a students' abilities.Real world financial education  They teach us about how to manage company funds, not how to manage our own funds.  In simple words: how to maxmimize our income &amp; gains(investing), &amp; not how to minimize your expenses(savings)  Every student nowadays own a smartphone worth of atleast 20k &amp; they dont even use to its full potential  i.e. we can do content creation, digital marketing, programming, learn trading &amp; many other things all this for free. ,  but they do they do instead ? Gaming typically battle royale like PUBG or Free Fire.  Or Social Media a new drug in the market, We can see “busy students” outside every education institutes, Scrolling through their facebook, twitter, instagram etc.Result  Traditional teaching apporoach(Theortical) + Out of date syllabus + Irrelevant subjects = A piece of paper that is of no use &amp; a human with no particular skill in hand.Solutions(How???)  More real world subjects like digital marketing.  Book keeping using erp softwares like Busy.  Enterprise Resource Mangement using Odoo Erp or Dolibarr.  Official work using presentations, spreadsheets etc.  New Passion related subjects like  Music Production using Digital Audio Workstation, Also Writing Lyrics.  Video Production using DSLR Cameras &amp; Processing it using Adobe premeier. Also writing screenplay or jokes for standup comedians  Renewable energy using solar panels &amp; wind mills etc.  Game development using Unity.  Android app development using kotlin &amp; android sdk.  Architectural planning using AutoCAD &amp; Autodesk Revit.  Web security using OWASP study material &amp; Burpsuite.  (…Insert any topic with their real world applications)  Freedom for students to choose what they want to be in their life, regardless of their gender, grades, or whatever.  btw i didnt included any medical &amp; engineering topics as they are already too common in india.  Learn by doing is always the best apporoach to learn something!Conclusion(When???)  I think we should all focus on heading towards the solutions  But sadly we’re mostly still stuck in time,  All I see is youngsters here in my area are just preparing for laid back 9 to 1 govt jobs (&amp; yes most govt. clerks work from 9am to 1pm, or govt. teachers 8am to 2pm max)  This is happening often due to herd mentality (i.e. sheep follow sheep)  Anyways My belief is Everything is Learned a Skill.  Nobody is born with talent/Skill  but exceptions are always there ;)Thank you very much for reading till the end, Hope you have a great day. :)",
