And also probably would have caused speed issues due to lack of network coverage in my roon.But even with my phone sitting in between two laptops (and i mean technically &amp; literally both here) and bummer i got like 3-4 MB data transfer speed :( and not only that ii was fluctuating cause of number of files i was transferring about 10GBand an average about 3 MB per fileSo i left it on for a while &amp; slept for like 1 hrand i woke at 2:30pm i guess &amp; it was still in progress -_- anyhow i let it run, there’s also another issue with wireless transfer, when i turned on Bluetooth to connect my wireless earphones to my phone, And then speed suddenly went down to like 949 kbps -_-This was happening due to air traffic between 2.4 ghz wifi &amp; 2.4ghz Bluetooth using same frequency band.that was my situation i can’t even use my phone for anything &amp; laptops are already busy transferring data, If you remember i was using my phone as wifi hotspot, and both laptops were connected to it. There’s also one problem with it was my phone didn’t had any internet pack available, so i was completely offline for like 3 hrs straight &amp; without any entertainment lolsThat was probably why i fell asleep XDFast forward to 3:30pm after transfer was complete i messaged my friend ben, and i informed him about the situation i was struggling with and asked for alternatives.He sent a photo of LAN Cable, and said it will useful in these scenarios &amp; i asked few question about if we could connect two laptops directly without any switch or router, and he said yes, after a while I remembered my brother had one LAN cable, which came in the tenda router box. I went to upstairs for tea break, and got the cable.Connected the cable from old laptop to new laptop, And this was my first experience with a LAN Cable, I started searching the internet for sharing files with a lan cable, found some articlesdid the typical network &amp; file sharing setup in windows 10 &amp; did test transfer of like 10GBof my music collection, about roughly 2100+ audio filesand it just took less than 15mins.I got like 10MBps or 100mbps and this time it was almost consistent 10MBps, And also i was to able to use my Bluetooth earphones &amp; internet(wifi) freely.",

            "content_text": "Problems or (What &amp; Why?)??Why people are chasing success? What do they mean by success? is financial success is everything?  As of now in 2021's India Most people think success is getting a govt. job &amp; that's it!But I dont think so? is govt job is keep up to everything want in life? No, its just a secure jobwhile nothing is permanent in this world, they think are settled, but in real life, nobody gets settledafter getting, we gotta repeat same things almost daily, and repetition is equal to boredom.  From my perespective i think life is about balacing all aspects of human a beings' life,I mean keeping everything balanced from work life to social life, childhood to parenthood, physical health to mental health everything needs to balanced, While our education system only teachs about how to get a job, not how to live a life.  Anyways here are some problems that i faced/found in our current indian education system while i was studying commerce from school &amp;  college.Irrelevant subjects  Like Business &amp; Industerial Laws, Hindi Language. This subject must be relevant to Law/Hindi specialization students only.  However these subjects can be recommended &amp; but not mandatory to study (Optionally any one can look it up on internet, if they want to).Out of date syllabus/circicullum  In modern day society accounting is mostly done through computers. But they dont teach us about computers  They dont teach us about Book Keeping softwares like Busy, Tally etc.  &amp; Even Nowadays from manufacturing to selling products or services whether they are tangible or intangible.  Are Now being done with the help of computers, E.g. Product design using solidworks, IoT devices to Aid in manufacturing, Online selling through ecommerce platforms like Amazon, Digital Marketing with Google Adsense &amp; FacebookAds.  In simple words “Internet &amp; Computers” are missing or I would rahther say ignored by our so called “Indian Education System”.Grade system, to test student ablilities (Yikes),  Cause we never know how much a student knows about something without testing him/her in a real world scenario.  Discussions/Debate/Interviews/Internships are good way to test a students' abilities.Real world financial education  They teach us about how to manage company funds, not how to manage our own funds.  In simple words: how to maxmimize our income &amp; gains(investing), &amp; not how to minimize your expenses(savings)  Every student nowadays own a smartphone worth of atleast 20k &amp; they dont even use to its full potential  i.e. we can do content creation, digital marketing, programming, learn trading &amp; many other things all this for free. ,  but they do they do instead ? Gaming typically battle royale like PUBG or Free Fire.  Or Social Media a new drug in the market, We can see “busy students” outside every education institutes, Scrolling through their facebook, twitter, instagram etc.Result  Traditional teaching apporoach(Theortical) + Out of date syllabus + Irrelevant subjects = A piece of paper that is of no use &amp; a human with no particular skill in hand.Solutions(How???)  More real world subjects like digital marketing.  Book keeping using erp softwares like Busy.  Enterprise Resource Mangement using Odoo Erp or Dolibarr.  Official work using presentations, spreadsheets etc.  New Passion related subjects like  Music Production using Digital Audio Workstation, Also Writing Lyrics.  Video Production using DSLR Cameras &amp; Processing it using Adobe premeier. Also writing screenplay or jokes for standup comedians  Renewable energy using solar panels &amp; wind mills etc.  Game development using Unity.  Android app development using kotlin &amp; android sdk.  Architectural planning using AutoCAD &amp; Autodesk Revit.  Web security using OWASP study material &amp; Burpsuite.  (…Insert any topic with their real world applications)  Freedom for students to choose what they want to be in their life, regardless of their gender, grades, or whatever.  btw i didnt included any medical &amp; engineering topics as they are already too common in india.  Learn by doing is always the best apporoach to learn something!Conclusion(When???)  I think we should all focus on heading towards the solutions  But sadly we’re mostly still stuck in time,  All I see is youngsters here in my area are just preparing for laid back 9 to 1 govt jobs (&amp; yes most govt. clerks work from 9am to 1pm, or govt. teachers 8am to 2pm max)  This is happening often due to herd mentality (i.e. sheep follow sheep)  Anyways My belief is Everything is Learned a Skill.  Nobody is born with talent/Skill  but exceptions are always there ;)Thank you very much for reading till the end, Hope you have a great day. :)",
