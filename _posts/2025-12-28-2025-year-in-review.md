title: "2025 Year in review"
---

Starting with work, as usual, Mostly remained same, in-fact it became a bit easy thanks to claude, But but, You need to test things out manually which is a bit time consuming, also if the code written have like small very minor bugs (runtime bugs to be specific), which are very hard to spot & catch, you have test the feature multiple times with different inputs to figure out the bugs.

One annoying thing for me is reading the AI generated code, it's good most of the times, but it makes mistakes that no human coder ever would. Like putting functions in the useState, using useCallback on every function inside the component, i won't blame AI for this, it's just react have this weird coding patterns. As backend code it writes a hell lot of utility functions, unnecessary abstractions, and sometimes even breaks the usual JS conventions.

Daily routine remained same as last year, till the month of may,

In may, i moved out a different place, previously i was staying in one 1RK apartment with one of my office colleague.

But Now i'm staying in a 3BHK, since i moved here, i made new friends, not just new but also hindi speaking ones, we are 4 guys here who are here everyday n night, And one guy comes only once in a week.

Also the rent is a bit lower than my previous stay.

And i also started cooking lunch as well, previously i used to cook breakfast & dinner only.

As for financial stuff, i got an increment this year, in the month of may, i guess, financially speaking i'm good for now, Also i started investing in stocks,

currently having with an unrealised loss :(, I brought the house stocks, aka BSE, NSDL & CDSL etc. And the reason is that my entry was at the wrong time, all these stocks were at their all time high, when i brought these stocks. Anyhow hopefully it will get recovered in the upcoming years. Also In the last two months, I did some IPOs as well, there i made good profits. :)

Some random stuff which i did this year:

In jan, i went to Mamalakandam, with [shaheem](https://shaheem.me/) on the bike, it was a great experience, because there not many people were there, we explored the area, clicked few photos, and came back the same day. Relatively short trip, But i like short trips more than long trips which extends more than 2-3 days day. :)

Booked tickets & went to attend a standup comedy show of [Abhishek Upmanyu](https://www.youtube.com/@aupmanyu) Initially i was thinking that i won't be able to laugh that much as an introvert, but as soon as show started, i couldn't able to control my laughter, because the jokes & punches were hilarious.

In the mid of July, i went to [kadambrayar bridge](https://www.keralatourism.org/destination/kadambrayar-boating-eocvillage/595/) along with my flatmates in the morning, very short trip, we reached there, and had some tea, clicked photos & had breakfast from outside, & came back to our flat, Also this short trip was sponsored by Me :)

In the end of July, i went to kadamakudy, it was office trip,

did kayaking for an hour, and it started raining in between, and i got fully wet, luckily my phone survived, after that we headed to [alappuzha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha), Onboarded on a house boat, had some drinks, had lunch, times flies, i really enjoyed the view from the house boat. After that we headed to [marari beach](https://www.keralatourism.org/kerala-article/2022/marai-beach-alappuzha/1204)

We sat on beach, stared at the incoming waves, enjoyed a lot!

After that we headed back to kochi.

In the mid of august, i went to [vattavada village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vattavada) with flatmates and few other guys.

It was two day trip, and we were 7 people, distance: 270KMs one way, the main goal for the trip is to see the mountains & also to try out magic mushrooms, It was once in lifetime experience.

So We left our flat at 3am on 15th august, reached that place at 9am,

took 2 breaks in between, had some tea & snacks, it was all rainy & cold, with some patchy sunshine in between.

Everything went great & we stayed there for one day & came back next day.

On 28 September 2025, i went to subash bose park with [ben](https://b3nsh4.com/)

I brought some dryfruits for the home, talked a lot about various things in life.

We sat down in the park, talked about tech, linux & life so far, did some deep thinking, thought about my life so far, and clicked some photos, and came back to flat.

After this day i had mental breakdown kinda, i can't share it because of some personal reasons, but it was terrible, i felt like i was used emotionally, And being ignored afterwards, I felt like i lost myself, the things that were once fun for me. those things no longer gave me any kind of joy, i used to do so many things like playing games, cooking & eating food of my choice, listening to music & podcasts etc. But none of these things were giving me any kind joy or satisfaction, i was overthinking, exhausted, anxious and my sleep was messed up entirely. I was in a terrible state of mind, but luckily it only lasted 2 weeks or something. So moving forward

On 11th Oct, took a flight to delhi, Spent some time with family, celebrated dewali & visited my sisters. Met two of my close school friends, but enjoyed a lot.
My inner peace returned, i started enjoying things slowly. And i cameback to kochi on 16th Nov. Things were normal from now on, I was back with a mature emotional mind. Until after sometime i started doing the same overthinking, but this time it was not that bad i would say. Anyhow, moving on

I started talking to him, and we talked about cricket, studies, language etc.

Attended the christmas party, had a few drinks for energy, danced for a few seconds (cause yk i'm an introvert), went to the pool, tried swimming but failed, had a lot of fun in the pool, after that i took a shower, had dinner, slept, woke up next day, packed my bags, & came back to flat.
