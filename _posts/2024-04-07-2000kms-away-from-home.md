# Life

It's been 3 months since i moved to kochi, kerela and i'm not missing much here, thanks to the ~~awesome~~ super hot weather & suburban vibes of kakkanad district, I live very close to the infopark.

If you like tech & like minded people then this is place, Here almost everybody is working in IT domain.
I share same building with 4 other tenants and All of them are developers, except one guy who once was a developer too but now into management (of developers ofc.)

There are just so many developers & so many people to learn from. During my first few days here, i met so many new devs (in person) which i don't think i could ever imagine back when i was working remotely, So many great people living & working here.

Also people are very grounded & humble as compared to delhi (Generally speaking although it depends from person to person, but overall i think this is comparatively better than delhi). So far never faced any issues while talking to people and asking for help.

Almost everyone here understands english & can talk to you in english, if you get lost anywhere just ask any young person near you and they'll guide you to your destination. P.S: Bro code works here as well.

And people even understand hindi and can speak broken hindi, this surprised me because i as a north indian can't understood a single word of malayalam because the reason is that i was totally unaware of culture of this place and as it's way too far from delhi (more than 2000 kms).

# Food

I really like the food here, its the perfect match for me when it comes to spices & cooking, They just cook till the perfection point, nothing more & nothing less, just perfect.

They just use the right amount of spices & oils. It's never too spicy like we have in delhi, So it's great for stomach, And so far never felt acidic or indigestion after eating from outside so far.

My current favourite is dosa, masala dosa to be specific. There are many varieties of dosa here like plain dosa, podi dosa, ghee roast dosa, cheese masala dosa. And all of them are served with 3 types of coconut chutneys (orange - spicy & tangy, white - coconutty if that's word, green - mint & coconut) & sambar curry.

And my second favourite idly which i've only tried two times, because it is mostly available for breakfast and i have a old habit of eating breakfast so mostly its gone by time the i reach restaurant.

And my third favourite is rice meals, which consists of boiled rice, 3-4 types of side curries, 1 main curry (usually sambar or rasam), a papadam, some curd, and some optional pickles and payasam which is dessert pudding and to be eaten after finishing the meal.

Also these only few of the dishes which i mentioned for vegetarians, if you're a non-vegetarian then you have a endless variety of seafood & meats they have everything here plus tons of restaurants serving arabian food.

Though if you're from north like me then you'll probably miss authentic north indian food. They do serve good north indian food and its tasty as well but you'll miss the punch of extra spiciness which is present in common north indian dishes like chole & rajma.

My current goto restaurant is "Just Tiffins" which is located near kakkanad junction, For north indian cuisines i think they are best for pure veg north indian food.

Lastly you gotta eat with your one hand which is norm here actually.

# Cinema

Its small (when compared to bollywood) and filled talented actors & directors & script writers, So far i've watched only one full length movie in theatre which is Bramayugam.

And it was a good experience because it was black & white, had very less dialogs which is good cause there were no subtitles. But i like indie stuff a bit more so i was looking for "malayalam short films with english subtitles".

Heres few which i've watched & liked:

- [Life on the rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMM4r6Hle7g)
- [New normal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_VGS7lGF64)

To be honest i want this post to be little bit more longer but this post was in draft since few weeks. So i'm just putting this out here before it gets too old.

Thanks for reading!
