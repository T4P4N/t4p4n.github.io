[10/10] Not gonna lie

#### How i found Trainspotting!?
i usually listen to doomer music which is basically classical rock genere mixed with sad vibes. Specifically I was watching this video:
[Crystal Castles - Vanished ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9XViPhRnOiQ) (This track is also amazing!!!)

In the description of this i found out the movie name

#### What i did after finding the movie name?  
i went straight to yts torrents, got .torr* file;
```aria2c filename.torrent```  
\>\>\> wait for 20 mins
And there you have it 1080p copy of Trainspotting

I try to avoid reading anything about a movie before watching it. I think its defeats the purpose of watching a movie, its removes the surprise from movie.  

if there are scenes of a movie appear in doomer music video then its probably Good or A masterpiece.  

#### Started watching it:
\>\>\> 11:30pm - 1:00am  
At first i thought its yet another "hollywood movie" after watching the movie i googled about it, Turned out It was a British masterpiece made in 1996. Also Its in the British top 100 movies of all time, at tenth spot tho. 


#### Plot
i dont wanna spoil it !!! if you're into drugs & crime genre & "you're quiet & sensitive type and your inner you is witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal & a little bit crazy & a little bit bad"  

You'll gonna love it that's my promise  

Also worth mentioning is the soundtracks
i personally really liked Atomic by sleeper & Temptation by new order.
Now its time for me to get a final hit (just kidding)  

Bye Bye  
Thanks for reading
