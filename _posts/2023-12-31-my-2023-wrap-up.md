This one is on my year 2023 review and how things went this year in my work & personal life.

### Work life

Starting from work life, i think i was fairly consistent this year when it comes to code contributions. This year i was able to master nestjs & prisma & react & went dive enough that i can figure out things on my own if enough time is given to me.

And now i also occaisonally go in source code of the libs to figure out how things are working behind fancy methods that a lib provides. Like last month i went a bit deep in shopify api js lib to figure out a server crash which was happening when using shopify api js lib for sessions turns out it was a lack of try catch block in our middleware.

And speaking of communication skills, i think i improved a lot. Now i can handle a meeting as a host for 4 teammates (including me), And previously i used to get frozen few times & mind goes blank when explaining a idea or a problem in front of my teammates. But now i also use a hack, which is to take notes before (if your the host) and after any meeting. And also i can help my teammates in debugging & brainstorming ideas and problems when needed by pairing via slack huddle or gmeet.

And one skill which i learned from handling customer support is to make reasonable yet ambigious promises for feature requests & bugfixes, from a developer prespective we never know how much time somethinig will take, so we ask for atleast 2 days even if the work is about 2 hours cause the code change needs to go through these phases, starting from the code review > manual testing > approval (if everything is ok) > staging (last manual test) finally release if everything is alright & monitoring the server & informing the client. And these things take time as usual so we need take this time into consideration.

Speaking to clients on call, like 99.9% users are generally very good & polite and dealing with them is easy for me. But Dealing with 0.1% is a bit daunting for me so i let my senior to deal with them.

All in all this year was turned out to be pretty great for me. We developed & launched around 4 apps which is not many but we explored other horizons too.

### Personal Life

One goal of mine was to focus on fitness, which i missed it entirely this year.

And also the diet even though i follow a strict vegetarian diet but i ate quite less this year, compared to last year. The reason for this is possibly due to my habit of sitting too long & not taking enough breaks while working, and this resulted in lack of appetite.

So for the next year i'll be focusing on regular excercising & try to put on atleast some amount of muscle.

And also one thing which i'm doing from past 2 years is to nightwalk and this year I was fairly consistent and walked for 4Kms or 5k steps almost daily. Here are some of pics i clicked this year:

#### Learnings this year (personal)

- Understanding power dynamics in family relations & making sure that no one will take any advantage of me.
- Keeping distance from toxic people and not letting interfere with my life decisions.
- Not chasing desires & people, desires come & go and same with people, and i don't try to chase them, and i try to go with the flow.
- Understanding my responsiblities & trying to reduce them gradually.

These were the few of major points which i learned this year,
And there are few things which i've done first time in my life:

- Travelling to bikaner (450kms) via train
- Walking 20k steps in one day, (was attending & assisting in a wedding ceremony)
- Buying shoes for myself (lols i don't like wearing shoes but i brought & wore them because of wedding ceremony)

Thank you very much for reading till the end. And Have a nice day.
