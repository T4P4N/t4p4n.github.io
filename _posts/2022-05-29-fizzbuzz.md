### problem statement:
- print fizz if the number is divisble by 3   
- print buzz if the number is divisble by 5   
- print fizzbuzz if the number is divisble by both 3 & 5   
- else just print the number.

```python

def fizzbuzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

n = int(input("> "))
fizzbuzz(n)
```

- Code is fairly simple to understand give it a try
- Else just Google it.
