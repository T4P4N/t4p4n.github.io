#### Backstory
its been like a week since i installed linux mint cinnamon (now xfce)
i was looking on the internet to enable xfce's inbuilt tiling feature from like past three days,
all i found was mostly to just remap keys with like super + up, down, left, right etc.
i've tried it maybe four times if i recall corrrectly. Somehow i stumbled upon this video today

i recommend to watch this video! if you have time!!!  

Here's the tldr;/text version of it.  

- Don\'t use map super key for anything, if it is already mapped to whisker menu
- Remap the keys from window manager -> keyboard with anything you like except super though
- QuickTip use alt key as most of us are used to use alt + tab to change window focus.
- QuickTip2 dont need install xcape for this (no need to add extra dependencies for simple stuff)


#### Here's mine keymapping for tiling.  


- Super + numpad/keypad up, down, left, right for widow tiling
