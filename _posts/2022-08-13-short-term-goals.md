title: 'Short term goals are important (rails)'
---


Let's start by defining what short term goal is:
Its a achievable in short duration i.e within days or months for example learning ruby on rails

### Create
- like something a todo/blog app just to get a hint of how things work in rails
- but only do this you haven't work with MVC architecture before. 
- Otherwise build something that uses some more framework specific features like rails helpers & concerns or other features specific to your project.

###  Modify 
- Read Code & Do incremental changes
- Take notes with pen & paper, also try drawing relationship b/w two or models.

### Observe
- Inspect generated migrations & schema
- Inspect db after migrations & also after seeding
- Read server logs & add print/puts statements in controllers it will give you a more clear idea about things are working internally.


### Watch & Read
- Watch videos about rails on YT checklout deanin , super rails, jesus castello railscasts etc.
- Read blogs, checkout saeloun, big binary, Ruby Guides, also checkout learn rails 6 by adam notodikromo if you're into books(like me)
- Read rails guide.

### Write & Debug
- don't be afraid to mess things up
- but if you did made a mess & it works
- then its responsiblity to clean it up 
- PS: you can write spaghetti code but also refactor it as much as possible.
- Do trial & error very important
