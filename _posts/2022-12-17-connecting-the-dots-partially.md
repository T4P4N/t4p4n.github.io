# Connecting the dots (partially)
I'm very happy to see how small things are coming together to help me in my day to day work life as a junior developer. My web dev journey as started in late 2020 which you read more about it [here](https://t4p4n.github.io/about/)

Before joining [storetools](https://storetools.io/), i had some little experience as i completed my first book [django 3 by example](https://www.packtpub.com/product/django-4-by-example-fourth-edition/9781801813051), it taught me [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architecture , [Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), Basic [request response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response) cycle etc.  As well as django specific things like [Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/templates/language/), [Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/), Django admin panel, APIs with [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). And also i got some more experience as I did few freelance projects with [Ben](https://b3nsh4.com). We got to learn many things such as working on a legacy code of Django 2 version, Extending with out own ideas such as implementing online payments into a old Hostel management system. Working on chat application that we made in [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) [socketio](https://socket.io/) & [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), that was my first intro to [event driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) programming. 

Also i used to learn [web security](https://owasp.org/) in 2019, which taught me how to use browser dev tools, And also learned frontend from [kevin powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) &  [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

Nowadays i work mostly with [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) & [react](https://reactjs.org/) & as well as some [liquid template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), 
which are kind of same tech but just with [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) flavour this time instead of [Python](https://www.python.org/), I can speed things up for me like 2x because of past experiences with Programming. TLDR; Learning never goes to waste... unless ofcourse its [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) & [rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) *





Btw its just the starting, That is why i named this post as Connecting the dots (partially), i have plenty of things to learn & utilize in future. So let's see how this goes.


Thanks for reading 
Bye Bye

\* (just kidding i still have plenty of space in my heart for  [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) & [rails](https://rubyonrails.org/))
